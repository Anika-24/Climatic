Climatic

In **Climatic**, which is a Weather App, I used '**React Native**' to build a smooth and responsive app that fetches weather data in real-time. By using '**fetch()**', I retrieve data from an external weather API, pulling key details like temperature, humidity, and a description of the weather based on latitude and longitude coordinates. When the app first loads, it shows a "loading..." message, keeping the user informed until the data is fetched. Once the data is available, the app dynamically displays the weather details. I also integrated local assets, like images, using '**require()**', which adds a visual layer to the app. I also used '**React Native's StyleSheet**' to ensure a clean, mobile-friendly user interface. Itâ€™s designed to adapt well across different screen sizes, making it a responsive and user-friendly experience!
